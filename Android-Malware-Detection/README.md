# 📱 Android Malware Detection

This project focuses on building a machine learning classifier to detect whether an Android application is **malicious** or **benign**, based on extracted features from APK files.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Given a dataset with extracted features from Android apps, build a robust classifier with high accuracy.

This project was submitted to a **Kaggle competition** and achieved **~90% accuracy**.

---

## 📊 Dataset

- Each row: one Android application
- Features include: permissions, activities, receivers, API calls, and more
- Label: `0` = benign, `1` = malicious

---

## 🔍 Models Used

Implemented and compared the performance of various models:

| Model Type | Variants |
|------------|----------|
| **Decision Tree (DT)** | Information Gain, weighted Gini |
| **Perceptron** | Standard, Averaged , Deacyed , Margin |
| **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** | Linear & RBF kernel with mRMR|
| **Ensemble (Adaboost)** | Boosted SVM / DT / Perceptron |

---

## 🏆 Best Result

- **Model**: Adaboost with SVM, Decision Tree, and Perceptron as base learners  
- **Accuracy**: **~90%** on Kaggle test set
